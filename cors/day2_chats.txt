Jaya Tulsiani9:50 PM
domain is same thats why?
Munish Thakur9:50 PM
is it related to browser's fetch api and not applicable to request made by browers directly?
Pratiyush Kumar9:51 PM
browser is same
i guess that's why
Pratiyush Kumar9:52 PM
yes
aravind g9:52 PM
yes
Mani Raj9:52 PM
Same origin policy applicable only for Fetch/XHR request alone?
Jaynil Gaglani9:53 PM
Is this due to the type of document?
Naman Saxena9:53 PM
Maybe because of type of request, not a fetch
yeah
Ankur Chaudhary9:53 PM
xhr call only
Rohan Salunke9:54 PM
Cross origin requests are blocked for security reasons of both client and the server. A request could be any request to the server be it a resource, iframe or ajax http request
arsalan khan9:54 PM
Sec-Fetch-Mode it has anything to do with this header field

I did not expect CORS to stretch this long and deep, still the tip of the iceberg 🤯
Pratiyush Kumar10:09 PM

Bilal Mansuri10:09 PM
for javascript, content-type is application/javascript, why is it allowed ?

Varchasvi Pandey10:10 PM
So if a request method is DELETE, 
It will just simply block it, no checks nothing

In browser, GET initiates first and then gets paused for Preflight.
In burpsuite, why Preflight initiated first and completed?
arsalan khan10:30 PM
Forget about everything how the interceptor is doing all this
Piyush Mahapatra10:30 PM
nice!
finally i can understand that error . thanks!
Mohamed Nazeer10:33 PM
But yeah,allowing all origins is bad practice @vicky. Assume you're using third party API to get some data from your API, which will be billed for certain requests. If you allow all origins, the number of hits will be high, and you'll be billed accordingly
Dhruvit Galoriya10:34 PM
yes

in express when we use that app.use(cors()) middleware , we are sending explicitly that option response
Satyam Lachhwani10:41 PM
Just wondering why script (JS) is allowed to be shared from different origin?

Does anyone know?
Piyush Mahapatra10:41 PM
yes
Vinayak Goyal10:41 PM
If the content type is text plain then we will see the response or not?
Pratiyush Kumar10:42 PM
basically browser matches request header and if the conditions are matched then No CORS error else it will give CORS error if any of the request header conditions fail
yes
Bilal Mansuri10:43 PM
yes
Pratik Kumar10:45 PM
in this  case.. does original request is reaching out to the server ???
Naman Saxena10:47 PM

Sahil Kalyani10:47 PM
Make status 200
Munish Thakur10:47 PM
and allow headers
Varchasvi Pandey10:48 PM
If a brand puts a 400 status code for Options call for all of their APIs, will it be helpful? Like will it aid the security
aravind g10:48 PM
yes!!
Viren Suthar10:49 PM
can we still get the response if we require a token in post API?
Jaynil Gaglani10:49 PM
status change is not present

Leetcode submission. You can't submit frequently. Similarly it'll block if there's n number of hits from one IP
